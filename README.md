This is my old experiment with the artificial life.

The code is a sort of a system where bacteria live (they can fork, eat, move
and die). Every bacteria has a genome, which is the program it uses to live.
The length of the genome has an impact on its life, since it becomes harder
to move and more energy is burned even when not moving.

In the current configuration, the system is initially filled with rather dumb
species, some of them eventually learn to move towards more food, but at some
point of time a good combination of qualities finally evolves in one of bacteria,
and its clones conquer the local universe and eat a large chunk of food.
As far as I saw, the genome becomes quite large at this point. Things seem to
stagnate after that, however, more parameter tuning might be required to see
more interesting behavior.
